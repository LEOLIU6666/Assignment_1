    <h1>Personal Information</h1>
    <p>My name is Quanrong LIU and people usually call me Leo. My RMIT email address is S3612232@student.rmit.edu.au. <br>I am from China but have been in Australia for 5 years and achieved my master degree in accounting and my permanent <br>visa in 2020.
    </p>
    <p>Currently, I live in Tasmania and will move to Melbourne very soon. I have a puppy called TiMi, which is also the name <br>of my partner’s favorite game development studio. He is Japanese Spitz which is very rare in Tasmania, people usually <br>interested in his color and shape.</p>

    <h1>Interest in IT</h1>
    <p> I am interested in Cyber Security and I think my interest starts in 2000. I was born in 1994 and in 2000 everyone was<br> celebrating new year but very soon the head titles of every newspaper were about ‘Y2K bug’. At that time, most people<br> didn’t have their own computer in China but everyone was talking about this interesting ‘bug’, and IT world just appeared <br>in front us. Everyone starts to know about this mystery IT world. </p>

    <p>I did some research before choosing RMIT. The first choice is Bootcamp and the Bootcamp says that it may take me more <br>than 6 months to find a front-end developer. And one of my friend who is working in Canva suggests me to learn IT in <br>RMIT because he knows that I want to learn IT because of my interest not just for a job. If I just want a job, Bootcamp<br> may be a good choice but I just want to learn more things about IT, then I should enroll in a university and learn everything <br>systematically.</p>

    <p>I tried some entry level course befor coming to RMIT such as <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python">Python for Everybody</a> or <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/learn-sql-basics-data-science">Learn SQL Basics for Data Science</a>. <br>I have some very basic knowledge about Python and database but I cannot put those skills into daily practice. So I hope I can<br> gain the ability to develop some application for myself whenever I need</p>





    <h1>Ideal job</h1>
      <img src="WeChat Image_20220322073216.jpg" alt="AFSA job"style="width:500px;height:600px;">
    <<p>I chose to work at <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/56286597?type=standout#sol=253e516e38f188f35cd93faaecf4c5a17063bf45">Australia Financial Security Authority</a> because it’s a government position which means the employer does<br> not need to consider about revenue and I can have a better work life balance than working in other for-profit organization. The <br>promotion system is also formal and we can have better development for our future career.</p>
    <p>This position requires us have experience with security operations environment and Splunk Administration, be familiar with <br>cloud security such as Azure and AWS. It also requires management skills such as Firewall Rule management and IDS/IPS<br> rule management and some certificates such as CISSP or CCSP and some other qualifications. Additionally, it also needs <br>some soft skills such as written and verbal communication skills.</p>
    <p>Honestly, I don’t have any of the above knowledge for now, but I am planning to gain those knowledge. At this stage, I think<br> IT fundamental knowledge is more important for me because this is a totally new area for me. I searched at Coursera and found<br> some fundamental course for cyber security and started to learn them. And when study Python, some course also introduce how <br>to use Python at Linux, I can start with it and learn more about Linux.</p>


    <h1>Personal profile</h1>
      <img src="myer test.jpg" alt="Myers-Briggs test"style="width:300px;height:300px;"> <img src="Learning style.jpg" alt="Learning style"style="width:300px;height:300px;"> <img src="The big five.jpg" alt="The big five"style="width:300px;height:300px;">
    <p>Honestly, I think the test result is accurate for me and I really cannot be a leader but I can be a real good team member because I care <br>about other people’s feeling and can finish things accurately. It also says I am good at visual learning which is also true. I usually get <br>confused when reading books and usually need to google for some real examples to help me understand abstract concept. I think I can <br>be the care giver in a team and make our working environment healthy.</p>

    <h1>Project Idea</h1>
    <<h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>It's an AI that can analyze the recording of lecture or other speech and can write a narrative summary about which part is the important <br>part for the recording and which part is useless for listener and write transcript for the user. So user can find exactly the information <br>they want and save their time.</p>
    <h3>Motivation</h3>
    <p>I have a full-time job while doing this BP162 course and I rely on Collaborate Ultra heavily because I need to watch the recording of<br> the lecture I missed. But I found normally a 2-hour lecture might contain at least 10 minutes unnecessary time such as daily greeting, <br>computer is not working etc. And I usually did some reading before watch the recording and the lecture may contains the information<br> that I have already know. So I hope there is an AI can make transcript of the recording and delete al those useless staff, and I can easily <br>find the things I want to watch.</p>
    <h3>Describe</h3>
    <p>This application can translate the recording into words which is just like ‘real-time subtitle’, and it also can show you the whole transcript<br> with exact time on it. User can browse the transcript and when people see the key words which you are interested in, you can just click it <br>and the video will start at that certain time.</p>

    <p>More important, this application can analyse the speech and find which part is important and which part is not related to this course and <br>show that on progress bar. And the lecture can be more ‘readable’ for user. For example, the professor may say “oh, I think my computer<br> is working now.” after fixing his computer and the application will know the professor’s pc was down and the silence time is not for<br> discussion which means it can be labelled as ‘not important’. Similarly, if the professor keeps repeating the same new word again and<br> again, the application may notice the professor is trying to introduce a new concept to us, so this part of recording should be labelled as<br> ‘important’ or the name of this new concept.
</p>
    <h3>Tools, technologies and skills</h3>
    <p>We can use Hidden Markov Model to translate the recording into context. EM algorithm is also necessary to train this Hidden Markov<br> Model. It can break the speech into bits which it can interpret and convert it into a digital format and analyze the piece of content. HTK <br>Speech Recognition Toolkit is also used for voice recognition.
Additionally, Natural Language Processing (NLP) can be used to understand <br>the speech and try to figure out the main topic of the lecture so that it can put label on progress bar. It also can match the transcript with <br>PPT and improve the accuracy.
</p>
    <h3>Outcome</h3>
    <p>If this application works successfully, we can watch the recording just like reading a book with catalogue. People can search the book <br>according to catalogue and we can find exactly the content in our recording. The user can understand the structure of this lecture and make <br>clear notes or summary. More importantly, user can watch the recording according to priority and save their time.</p>
